9. RECORDS AND AUDIT.

9.1. During any Subscription Term and for two (2) years thereafter, you shall maintain accurate records of your Subscription use sufficient to show compliance with the terms of this Agreement. During this period, OpenNMS will have the right to audit your Subscription use to confirm compliance. That audit is subject to reasonable notice by OpenNMS and will not unreasonably interfere with your business activities. OpenNMS may conduct at most one (1) audit in any twelve (12) month period, and only during normal business hours. You will reasonably cooperate with OpenNMS and any third party auditor and will, without prejudice to other rights of OpenNMS, address any non-compliance identified by the audit by promptly paying additional Subscription fees. You will promptly reimburse OpenNMS for all reasonable costs of the audit if the audit reveals either underpayment of more than five (5%) percent of the Subscription fees payable by you for the period audited, or that you have materially failed to maintain accurate records of Subscription use.

10. WARRANTIES.

10.1. Software Warranty. OpenNMS warrants to you that the Software will, for a period of ninety (90) days following delivery (the "Warranty Period"), substantially conform to the applicable Documentation, provided that the Software: (a) has been properly installed and used at all times in accordance with the applicable Documentation; and (b) has not been modified or added to by person other than OpenNMS or its authorized representative. OpenNMS will, at its own expense and as its sole obligation and your exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, either replace that Software or correct any reproducible error in that Software reported to OpenNMS by you in writing during the Warranty Period. If OpenNMS determines that it is unable to correct the error or replace the Software, OpenNMS will refund to you the amount paid by you for that Software, in which case the License for that Software will terminate.

10.2. Software Disclaimer of Warranty. OTHER THAN THE WARRANTY ABOVE, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OPENNMS AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY STATUTE, OPERATION OF LAW, COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. OPENNMS AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT IT WILL BE FREE FROM DEFECTS OR THAT IT WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.

11. INDEMNIFICATION.

11.1. Defense and Indemnification. Subject to the remainder of this Section 11 (Indemnification) and to Section 12 (Limitation of Liability), OpenNMS shall defend you against any third party claim that the Software infringes any patent, trademark or copyright, or misappropriates a trade secret (but only to the extent that the misappropriation is not a result of your actions) under the laws of the United States (an "Infringement Claim") and indemnify you from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against you to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in settlement. The foregoing obligations are applicable only if you: (i) promptly notify OpenNMS in writing of the Infringement Claim; (ii) allow OpenNMS sole control over the defense for the claim and any settlement negotiations; and (iii) reasonably cooperate in response to OpenNMS requests for assistance. You may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the prior written consent of OpenNMS.

11.2. Remedies. If the alleged infringing Software becomes, or in OpenNMS's opinion be likely to become, the subject of an Infringement Claim, OpenNMS will, at OpenNMS's option and expense, do one of the following: (a) procure the rights necessary for you to make continued use of the affected Software; (b) replace or modify the affected Software to make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate the License to the affected Software and discontinue the related support services, and, upon your certified deletion of the affected Software, refund the fees paid by you for the License to the affected Software, less straight-line depreciation over a three (3) year useful life beginning on the date such Software was delivered. Nothing in this Section 11.2 (Remedies) shall limit OpenNMS's obligation under Section 11.1 (Defense and Indemnification) to defend and indemnify you, provided that you promptly replace the allegedly infringing Software with alternative Software provided to you by OpenNMS or, alternatively, discontinue using the allegedly infringing Software upon receiving OpenNMS's notice terminating the affected License.

11.3. Exclusions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, OpenNMS will have no obligation under this Section 11 (Indemnification) or otherwise with respect to any claim based on: (a) a combination of Software with non-OpenNMS products; (b) use for a purpose or in a manner for which the Software was not designed; (c) use of any older version of the Software when use of a newer OpenNMS version would have avoided the infringement; (d) any modification to the Software made without OpenNMS's express written approval; or (f) any Software provided on a no-charge, beta, or evaluation basis. THIS SECTION 11 (INDEMNIFICATION) STATES YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND OPENNMS'S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS OR ACTIONS.

12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

12.1. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OPENNMS AND ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

12.2. Liability Cap. THE LIABILITY OF OPENNMS AND ITS LICENSORS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE LICENSE FEES YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR $5,000. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OPENNMS OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

13. TERMINATION.

13.1. Agreement Term. The term of this Agreement begins upon the Acceptance Date and continues until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with this Section 13 (Termination).

13.2. Termination for Breach. OpenNMS may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon written notice to you if: (a) you fail to pay any portion of the fees under an applicable Order within ten (10) days after receiving written notice from OpenNMS that payment is past due; or (b) you breach any other provision of this Agreement and fail to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of OpenNMS's written notice thereof.

13.3. Termination for Insolvency. OpenNMS may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon written notice to you if you: (a) terminate or suspend your business; (b) become insolvent, admit in writing your inability to pay your debts as they mature, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or become subject to control of a trustee, receiver or similar authority; or (c) become subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

Upon OpenNMS's termination of this Agreement, your License to the Software will immediately cease and you must cease all use of the Software and return, or if requested by OpenNMS, destroy, any related OpenNMS Confidential Information in your possession or control and certify in writing to OpenNMS that you have fully complied with these requirements. Any provision will survive any termination or expiration if by its nature and context it is intended to survive, including Sections 1 (Definitions), 3 (License Restrictions), 5 (Ownership), 7.2 (Configuration Data Confidential), 9 (Records and Audit), 10.2 (Software Disclaimer of Warranty), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Termination), 14 (Confidential Information) and 15 (General).

Recipient will protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as Recipient protects its own confidential or proprietary information of a similar nature but with no less than reasonable care.

14.3. Exceptions. Recipient's obligations under Section 14.2 (Protection) with respect to any Confidential Information will terminate if Recipient can show by written records that such information: (a) was already known to Recipient at the time of disclosure by Disclosing Party; (b) was disclosed to Recipient by a third party who had the right to make such disclosure without any confidentiality restrictions; (c) is, or through no fault of Recipient has become, generally available to the public; or (d) was independently developed by Recipient without access to, or use of, Disclosing Party's Information. In addition, Recipient will be allowed to disclose Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or by the order of a court of similar judicial or administrative body, provided that Recipient notifies Disclosing Party of such required disclosure promptly and in writing and cooperates with Disclosing Party, at Disclosing Party's request and expense, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.
