==== What's New in Meridian 2017

Since Meridian 2016, a huge number of backend changes have occurred, including a large refactor of provisioning, many cleanups in Enlinkd, and a number of new features including the Business Service Monitor.

===== Important Upgrade Notes

* *Clean Up Events and Alarms*: Please clean up your event and alarm lists as much as possible before performing an upgrade to Meridian 2017.
  The upgrade process includes a change to move event parameters to a separate table, rather than being encoded in a column in the event table.
  If you prune unused data from these tables beforehand, it will make the upgrade process much quicker.
* *Remote Poller API Change*: Due to internal API changes, the Remote Poller API has changed in Meridian 2017.
  If you upgrade to Meridian 2017, you will also need to upgrade all Remote Pollers attached to the system to 2017 as well.
* *Cassandra JMX Metrics*: The default value for the `friendly-name` attribute on the `JMX-Cassandra` collection service has changed from `cassandra21x` to `cassandra`.
+
This changes the path in which the metrics are stored.
If you have already been collecting these metrics and wish to preserve them, you can ignore this change when merging your configuration.
* *Jetty 9.4 Upgrade*: Jetty has been upgraded from `8.1` to the latest `9.4`.
+
If you have a custom `jetty.xml` in your `etc` folder, you will need to migrate your changes.
Use `etc/examples/jetty.xml` as a starting point.
* *Drools 6.5.0 Upgrade*: Drools has been upgraded from `6.0.1.Final` to `6.5.0.Final`.
+
If you have custom Drools rules, they may need to be revised.
The compiler used in `6.5.0.Final` is stricter than the compiler in previous versions.
* *Separate opennms-webapp-remoting Package*: The webapp that supports the Remote Poller has been separated from the main OpenNMS webapp.
+
This will make installations much smaller for users that do not use the Remote Poller.
If you use the Remote Poller, you will need to install the `meridian-webapp-remoting` package.
* *User roles moved from magic-users.properties into users.xml*: The `users.xml` file now contains a list of roles for each user alongside the rest of the user attributes.
* *JICMP 2.0 Upgrade*: Our Java ICMP library has been upgraded to version 2.0.
+
You will need to upgrade to this version before upgrading to OpenNMS Meridian 2017.
* *org.opennms.newts.nan_on_counter_wrap*: If you are using Newts, returning NaN when a counter-wrap is encountered now defaults to true.
+
If you relied on the old behavior, you can change it back by setting `org.opennms.newts.nan_on_counter_wrap=false` in a file in `opennms.properties.d`.

===== Breaking Changes

* *Custom Topology Icon Definitions*: Custom Icon Definitions in the Topology Map are now handled differently.
+
You will need to migrate your existing custom icons to the new layout.  The link:http://meridian.opennms.com/docs/2017/latest/guide-admin/#_icons[Administrators Guide] covers this topic in more detail.
* *Event Translator*: The default behavior of the event translator preserving SNMP data when cloning event has been changed to *_NOT_*
preserve that data by default.
+
To restore the old behavior, set `preserve-snmp-data="true"` on the event XML.
For more information, see link:http://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-8374[issue NMS-8374].
* *ReST API*: The ReST API has been normalized to give better and more consistent responses to queries.
+
This includes dropping support for redirecting to the model URL on write operations (POST, etc.)
If you were relying on this old (broken) behavior, please update your ReST API calls accordingly.
Most client code should be unaffected.
* link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-9303[NMS-9303]: Deprecated Capsd and Linkd event definitions are removed.
+
Otherwise unused event definitions are also cleaned up and removed from the code and configurations.
For a detailed list of all removed events see link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-9303[NMS-9303].
For people maintaining databases prior to OpenNMS 1.8, we provide a maintenance script for Linux and Windows in the _opennms-contrib_ package to clean up old events in the database.
The script is named `NMS-9303-cleanup-deprecated-events.sh` and executes a SQL script.
In case you run PostgreSQL on Windows, you can use `psql.exe -d opennms -U opennms -W -a -f NMS-9303-cleanup-deprecated-events.sql` to run the maintenance script.

===== New Features

* *Business Service Monitor*: Correlation for root cause and business impact analysis.
+
The goal of the Business Service Monitor is to provide a high-level correlation of business rules, and to display them in the topology map.
+
In the BSM, you define a Business Service that encompasses a set of entities (nodes, interfaces, services, and other Business Services) and the relationships among them.
The alarm states of the component entities are rolled up in a map-reduce fashion to drive a state machine.
The state of a Business Service is reflected in a new type of event, and can also be visualized (along with the service hierarchy) in the existing OpenNMS topology map.
+
For details on using the BSM, see link:http://meridian.opennms.com/docs/2017/latest/guide-admin/#ga-bsm#ga-bsm[the Administrators Guide].
* *Modular Configuration Updates*: Now most properties set in the `opennms.properties` file can be instead overriden by creating a file in the `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d` directory.
* *Notifications*: New notification strategies for Slack and Mattermost have been added.
* *OpenNMS Plugin Manager*: An API for adding 3rd-party "plugins" to OpenNMS.
+
The core of a tool for adding plugins into OpenNMS has been included in Meridian 2017.
This provides a set of tools for finding and adding plugins to be loaded into the OpenNMS OSGi container.
* *Provisioning Requisition UI*: A huge number of improvements have gone into the requisition UI.
Also, the old "Quick-Add Node" functionality has been reimplemented using the same backend as the requisition UI.
* *"Scan Report" Remote Poller GUI*: A new front-end for the remote poller that lets you perform a single scan and get a pass/fail report in a GUI has been added.
You can enable this alternate UI with the "-s" option on the remote poller CLI.
* *Topology UI Updates*: As part of the BSM work, the topology UI has been vastly improved for both performance and usability.
* *TSRM Ticketing Plugin*: Create incidents in IBM's TSRM.
+
Information on configuring the TSRM ticketing plugin can be found in link:http://meridian.opennms.com/docs/2017/latest/guide-admin/#ga-ticketing-tsrm[the Administrators Guide].
* *Usage Statistics*: Collect anonymous usage statistics.
+
To get a better idea of how to estimate hardware requirements and the performance characteristics of OpenNMS, we wrote a tool to occasionally submit anonymous diagnostic information about your OpenNMS install.
It will submit information like the number of nodes, alarms, etc. as well as some basic system information to our servers for statistical reasons.
+
When a user with the Admin role logs into the system for the first time, they will be prompted as to whether or not they want to opt-in to publish these statistics.
Statistics will only be published once an Administrator has opted-in.
+
These statistics are visualized on link:https://stats.opennms.org[stats.opennms.org].
* *GraphML Topology Provider*: A new Topology Provider is available that reads GraphML formatted graphs and displays them in the the Topology UI.
* *OpenNMS Elasticsearch ReST Forwarder*: This Elasticsearch forwarder can store events, alarms, and alarm state changes in Elasticsearch for archival or searching.
It is compatible with all currently supported versions of Elasticsearch.
* *Drools Persistence*: Drools working memory can now be persisted to disk upon shutdown of OpenNMS.
* *Unified JAAS Authentication*: The web UI, the Apache Karaf OSGi console, and the built-in ActiveMQ broker all use a single authentication method.
* *Monitoring Location Events*: Events will be sent when Monitoring Locations are added, updated, or deleted.
* *External JMS broker*: It is possible to configure OpenNMS to use an external JMS broker if desired.
* *New Syslog Parser*: A new syslog parser, the `RadixTreeSyslogParser`, has been added, which supports all major syslog message formats, and uses Grok for more performant parsing.
* *String Persisting over TCP*: The TCP persister can now persist string values.
* *ICMP traffic class and don't-fragment support*: It is possible to configure OpenNMS to set DSCP traffic class and "don't fragment" bits when polling ICMP.
* *Geographical Maps*: Geographical maps are now included by default in the center of the Web UI front page.
* *Web UI improvements*: Location information has been added to many places in the UI, and a number of pages have been enhanced including the BSM editor and topology UI.
* *Asset Topology Provider*: The Asset Topology Provider generates a GraphML topology based on node metadata including asset fields.
  link:http://meridian.opennms.com/docs/2017/latest/guide-admin/#_asset_topology_provider[(more details)].
* *Alarm Sounds*: The web UI can now optionally flash and play an alert sound when alarms are created and optionally updated.
  link:http://meridian.opennms.com/docs/2017/latest/guide-admin/#ga-alarm-sounds[(more details)].

===== Events

New or updated trap definitions have been added for the following classes of devices:

* APC
* Juniper IVE
* NetGear ProSafe Smart Switch
* OpenWRT
* SonicWall

===== Data Collection

* AKCP SensorProbe
* Cisco ASA5515-X and ASA5525-X
* Juniper SRX100h and SRX210he2 Router
* *HTTP*:
** Elasticsearch
* *JMX*:
** Apache Kafka
** VMware vCenter Server 6.0.0

===== Other Improvements

As always, many updates and cleanups have been made to the OpenNMS core, through refactoring, addition of unit tests, and other code modernization.

* *Minion Infrastructure*: Minion is OpenNMS's project to provide full distributed monitoring and collection.
+
While the Minion is not supported in Meridian 2017, the work that went towards Minion support (modernizing polling and data collection) is included.
* *ActiveMQ*: An ActiveMQ broker is now embedded in the OpenNMS JVM.
* *Discovery Daemon Rewrite*: The discovery daemon has been replaced with a Camel-based implementation to facilitate future Minion support.
* *Enhanced Linkd*: Enlinkd has had many bugs fixed and should perform orders of magnitude faster in many configurations.
* *JNA*: The JNA ping implementation got cleaned up and received many improvements.
* *Newts*: A number of bugfixes and improvements have been made to the Newts support since Meridian 2017.
* *Syslog Daemon Updates*: The performance of the OpenNMS syslog support has been vastly improved and updated.
* We replaced all of the GWT components in the web UI with AngularJS components.
+
This reduces the complexity of the UI code and will make it easier for developers with Javascript experience to maintain and contribute to the UI.
* All Javascript dependencies for the web UI are now managed by Bower and Gulp.
* Jasper reports are now automatically recompiled if changed.
* The JIRA ticketer has been improved.
* The default database connection pool has been switched from c3p0 to HikariCP (http://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/) to increase performance.
* Our ICMP libraries are now capable of being run by non-root users (although OpenNMS is not yet configured to support this).
* The startup order of OpenNMS has been improved to make sure that a number of time-sensitive event-consuming daemons are ready immediately after Eventd, and before traps are consumed.
* Collection APIs have been refactored and cleaned up immensely as part of refactoring for future Minion support.
* JSON datacollection now supports properly handling responses that return an array.
* Path handling for collection resources has been improved.
* Many improvements have been made to the documentation, including documentation for collectors, detectors, and monitors, as well as Karaf shell commands and event sources.
* A number of improvements to geolocation resolution and node maps have been made.
* Internal OpenNMS events have been cleaned up and broken into logical parts in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc`.
* Graphs that use relative time periods have additional drop-down choices now.
* The topology infrastructure has been vastly improved, with MANY bug fixes and performance improvements.
* Fix a thread leak in SNMP queries that can happen when old connections don't get closed properly.
* Fix a long-standing bug in the `vacuumd-configuration.xml` that referred to the wrong ticket state for "closed".
* Fix calculation of KSC report "Last Week" and "This Week" timespans.
* Fix startup on systems without any IPv6 support.
* Reverse lookups in provisioning now handle IPs without a corresponding A record.

[releasenotes-changelog-Meridian-2017.1.10]

==== Release Meridian-2017.1.10

Release 2017.1.10 is a small update to OpenNMS Meridian 2017.1.9.
It contains a critical RADIUS fix as well as a number of smaller enhancements.

The codename for 2017.1.10 is _Capitol meridian_.

===== Breaking Change: trapd-configuration.xml

Meridian 2017.1.10 includes a https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-10242[bug fix that introduces validation of the Trapd config file].
In the process of testing this fix we found that the `trapd-configuration.xml` that shipped with Meridian 2017 had issues that could prevent proper configuration of the `snmp-trap-address`.

To fix your `trapd-configuration.xml` file, make the following changes:

* If your `trapd-configuration.xml` contains an attribute called `snmpv3-user-count`, delete it.
* If your `trapd-configuration.xml` has `<snmp-trap-address>...</snmp-trap-address>`, delete that element and add an `snmp-trap-address="..."` attribute to the enclosing `<trapd-configuration />` tag instead.  (The only thing that should be inside the `<trapd-configuration>` tag is `<snmpv3-user>` elements.)

.Before:
----
<trapd-configuration snmpv3-user-count="0" queue-size="10000"
    include-raw-message="false" new-suspect-on-trap="false"
    batch-interval="500" batch-size="1000" snmp-trap-port="162" threads="0">
    <snmp-trap-address>*</snmp-trap-address>
</trapd-configuration>
----

.After:
----
<trapd-configuration snmp-trap-address="*" queue-size="10000"
    include-raw-message="false" new-suspect-on-trap="false"
    batch-interval="500" batch-size="1000" snmp-trap-port="162" threads="0">
</trapd-configuration>
----

===== Breaking Change: RADIUS Authentication Provider

A security issue in the `RadiusAuthenticationProvider` has been fixed (Issue http://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-10212[NMS-10212])
This requires changes to the `radius.xml` file located in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/spring-security.d`.
Now instead of providing a bean for the `authTypeClass` property, it is sufficient to just provide the class name:

.Before
