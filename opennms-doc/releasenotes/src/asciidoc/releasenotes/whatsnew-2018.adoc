=== OpenNMS Meridian 2018

==== System Requirements

* *Java 8*: OpenNMS Meridian 2018 requires Java 8 as the runtime environment.
  To run Meridian 2018, we recommend the most recent version of Oracle JDK 8 for your platform.
* *PostgreSQL 9*: Meridian 2018 requires PostgreSQL 9.x, version 9.2 or higher.

==== What's New in Meridian 2018

The biggest addition in Meridian 2018 is official support for link:https://meridian.opennms.com/docs/2018/latest/guide-install/guide-install.html#gi-minion[the Minion].
Minion is an agent-like tool for remote monitoring isolated networks as if OpenNMS could reach them locally.

On top of that, there have been many smaller improvements and enhancements since Meridian 2017.

Meridian 2018 roughly matches the feature set available in Horizon 21 and parts of Horizon 22.

===== Important Upgrade Notes

* *org.opennms.newts.nan_on_counter_wrap*: If you are using Newts, returning NaN when a counter-wrap is encountered now defaults to true.
  If you relied on the old behavior, you can change it back by setting `org.opennms.newts.nan_on_counter_wrap=false` in a file in `opennms.properties.d`.
* Event parameters have been moved to their own table, rather than being embedded (preformatted) in the `events` table.
  If you have a large number of events and/or event parameters in your database, the conversion while running `install` may take as long as an hour or even more.
  It is recommended that you archive and delete old events you do not need anymore before upgrading.

===== Breaking Changes

* link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-9303[NMS-9303]: Deprecated Capsd and Linkd event definitions are removed.
  Otherwise unused event definitions are also cleaned up and removed from the code and configurations.
  For a detailed list of all removed events see link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-9303[NMS-9303].
* *Elasticsearch 1 API*: The old Elasticsearch API has been removed in favor of the Elasticsearch ReST plugin, which should support most Elasticsearch API versions.
  Instructions on configuring the Elasticsearch ReST plugin are available in link:http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/latest/guide-admin/guide-admin.html#_elasticsearch_rest_plugin[the Administrators Guide].
* Property format change of `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketLinkTemplate`:
  Originally the `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketLinkTemplate` defined in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties` requires the full `<a href="...">${id}</a>` link to be configured.
  This is changed to the ticketer system url, e.g. `https://issues.opennms.org/browse/${id}` instead of `<a href="https://issues.opennms.org/browse/${id}">${id}</a>`.
  If the `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketEnabled` is `true` then the `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketLinkTemplate` must be updated as well in order to not break the link to an external ticketing system on the Alarm Details Page.
* Event parameters:
  There are a few side-effects of the event parameter changes.
  ** When you view or retrieve an alarm it will always have the parameters of the newest event associated with it.
  ** Vacuumd no longer honors the `add-all-parms` attribute on an `action-event`.
* Changes to `TCPAddress` and `UDPAddress` format in `eventd-configuration.xml`:
  When Eventd was converted to use Camel under the covers, the format for listening on all interfaces changed from a wildcard (`*`) to `0.0.0.0`.
  Note that despite looking like an IPv4 format, the JVM interprets `0.0.0.0` as listening on _all_ interfaces, IPv4 and IPv6.

===== New Features

* *Minion*: OpenNMS Meridian now supports running Minions.
* *IBM Tivoli Event Integration Facility*: Support has been added to bridge EIF events into OpenNMS Horizon.
  link:https://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/latest/guide-admin/guide-admin.html#ga-events-sources-eif[(more details)]
* *Asset Topology Provider*: The Asset Topology Provider generates a GraphML topology based on node metadata including asset fields.
  link:http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/latest/guide-admin/guide-admin.html#_asset_topology_provider[(more details)].
* *Alarm Sounds*: The web UI can now optionally flash and play an alert sound when alarms are created and optionally updated.
  link:http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/latest/guide-admin/guide-admin.html#ga-alarm-sounds[(more details)].
* *ReST Updates*: A new experimental ReST API (`/opennms/api/v2`) has been enabled which supports https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/[JEXL].
* The topology UI now supports link:http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/latest/guide-development/guide-development.html#gd-topology-graphml-vertex-status-provider[scriptable vertex status].
* *Alarm Northbounders*: There are link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-9513[new alarm northbounders] for running arbitrary BSF scripts or forwarding to Drools.
* *Web UI*: It is now possible to link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-10072[customize the date format] used in the UI.
  You can configure it by overriding the `org.opennms.ui.datettimeformat` property in `opennms.properties`.
* *Hawtio*: Hawtio is now included as an optional webapp package (`opennms-webapp-hawtio`) for convenience.
* *IFTTT*: Support has been added for triggering IFTTT events based on alarms.

===== Events

New or updated trap definitions have been added for the following classes of devices:

* IBM EIF
* IETF DLSW
* IETF DOCSIS
* Other IETF traps

===== Other Improvements

* The Karaf OSGi container has been upgraded from 2.x to 4.1.5.
* The IPLIKE C and Pl/pgsql versions have been cleaned up and normalized to work the same between implementations.
* Many ActiveMQ/Camel/Kafka/etc. RPC-related APIs have been cleaned up and improved.
* Much of the data collection infrastructure has been updated and cleaned up as part of adding and improving Minion support.
* Asset addresses are now resolved to coordinates during provisioning, rather than at runtime.
* A number of improvements have been made to RADIUS support.
* It is now possible to reload Drools configuration without restarting OpenNMS.
* Many improvements were made to Enlinkd, especially in the bridge discovery code.
* Drools has been updated to 7.x.
  It should be backwards compatible with existing 6.x-based Drools configurations.
* Many other small enhancements and fixes for the topology UI.
